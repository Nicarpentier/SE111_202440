        <p style="border: 1px color red;">Hey! Over the summer I turned 21 and had a blast. Went around to different pubs and tried various drinks and cocktails. Also picked up pool recently with my family we go out play a few. Besides that nothing else really went on, still wearing a box on my head almost daily. See you next class KT!</p>
