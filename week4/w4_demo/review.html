            <h2>The Review | <em>Deadpool</em></h2>
            <p><b>Nicholas Carpentier</b>, <i>August 8th, 2024</i></p>
            <h4>&#9733;&#9733;&#9733;&#9733;&#9733;</h4>
            <p>I really enjoyed the first movie for Deadpool. It came as a suprise as Marvel didn't want to make one originally. After the poor preformance he made during X-Men: Origins, I thought they didn't care about him as a character. But they took it seriously and delievered. It was a a hit, from begining to end it was hilarious. The CGI and fights were thoughtout and punchlines were on point.</p>

            <p>The plot of the movie was consise and flowed great. They gave background and infomration for an audience that wouldn't know who he was from the comics. Besides that, the overall story didn't have much filler that wasn't needed and everything worked in unison to make you feel at the end of the movie "its over already?" The ending of the movie aswell was strong. Compared to the newer release <em>Deadpool & Wolverine</em> which I thought was lackluster.</p>
